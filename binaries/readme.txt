Download the 'ASCII Grid & GML (Grid)' OS Terrain 50 data file from
https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/Terrain50. This is currently
named as 'terr50_gagg_gb.zip'.

This executable will unzip that file and create the binary data
file 'osterrain50.bin' from the unzipped data.

The downloaded zip file and unzipped OS Terrain 50 data can then 
be deleted.

Windows: unzip the .exe file then run in PowerShell as:
.\osterrain50.exe path\to\terr50_gagg_gb.zip

Mac: drag the executable 'osterrain50' from the dmg and run in a
terminal as:
./osterrain50 path/to/terr50_gagg_gb.zip

Ubuntu: extract the executable 'osterrain50' and run in a terminal as:
./osterrain50 path/to/terr50_gagg_gb.zip
