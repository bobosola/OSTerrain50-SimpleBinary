<h1>Utility Scripts</h1>

``release.sh`` builds a Universal 2 Binary for x86_64 & ARM64 macs (NB: the directory paths must exist).

``unzip.sh`` is for use where you may want to unzip the OS zip file independently. Written for use on Macs but easily editable for other Unix-like platforms. The OS zip file is difficult to unzip by hand as the parent zip contains 2858 child zips in multiple sub-directory trees.
